// The three pillars of Redux

/* 
    1. global storage -> in Redux it is called store
    -> generate a new state is called Action and we have to dispatch the Action
    2. generate new state from the component and go to the modifier -> Action Dispatch
    3. modifier is called Reducer function() in Redux
