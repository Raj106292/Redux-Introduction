// Why should we use Redux?

/* 
    1. by using redux all components (grand parent, parent, child) get the data from global state
    2. we don't need to think for props drilling
    3. we can use child component state value in parent component easily
    4. We can handle asynchronous call by RTK query -> fetch the data by RTK query and save it on the global storage
    5. Redux handle data fetch, refetch and cash by RTK query/ Redux toolkit
